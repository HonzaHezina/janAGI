# Security notes

This stack includes components that can store credentials and execute actions. Treat it like **production infrastructure** from day 1.

## Secrets
- Use Coolify secrets/env var store.
- Never commit `.env`, tokens, or credential files to git.

## n8n API key
- If you use the Workflow Builder pattern, create an API key in n8n and store it as `N8N_API_KEY`.
- Treat it like a password; anyone who has it can create/update workflows via API.

## n8n encryption key
Set `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from day 1 and never change it unless you intentionally rotate credentials.

## OpenClaw hardening essentials
OpenClaw stores sensitive state under `~/.openclaw/` (config, credentials, sessions, transcripts). If you deploy it:

- **Internal-only networking:** OpenClaw must NOT have public ports. Keep it internal (`http://openclaw:18789`) behind the Docker network. If you must expose for debugging, bind only to loopback: `127.0.0.1:18789:18789`.
- **Auth required:** Always configure token/password auth (`OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`).
- **Least privilege:** Use dedicated agents with strict tool allowlists (e.g., `ui-operator` agent with only browser tools, no CLI).
- **Rotate secrets:** If compromised, rotate OpenClaw token/password and all provider credentials immediately.
- **Endpoint control:** `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions` are disabled by default. Only enable what you need.
- **Session isolation:** Use `user` field in requests for stable session keys. Never share sessions between users/workflows.

## Data retention
Leads/messages can include personal data. Add a retention policy (e.g., delete/anon after 30–90 days) if needed.

## OpenClaw HTTP endpoints
- `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions` are **disabled by default**; only enable what you need.
- Prefer internal-only networking (`http://openclaw:18789`) and auth tokens.
- Consider a dedicated `ui-operator` agent with strict tool allowlist and a separate session key.

## Credential map for Jackie router/subflows
- Telegram bot token — WF_42 triggers and replies
- Postgres (`rag.*`) — logging runs/events/artifacts
- Google Calendar/Tasks/Gmail creds — WF_43/44/45
- OpenClaw bearer (`OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) — WF_10/11/12/41/48 and any Turbo calls
- n8n operator creds (`N8N_OPERATOR_EMAIL`, `N8N_OPERATOR_PASSWORD`) — UI operator pattern
- n8n API key (`N8N_API_KEY`) — API builder pattern
- SpecKit webhook/base URL — WF_49

Use env/secrets only; do not embed IDs or tokens directly in workflow JSON. Rotate credentials if exported or leaked.
